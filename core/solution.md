# Project Purple Cow - Fearless Application

## General info
This project is a React Application that uses CounterAPI to track the number of visits on the web application. This application increments the view counter by 1 for each time the button is click by the user.

## Technologies
React
Chrome Browser

## Setup
To run this project:
Download from Git repo
install it locally using
### `npm install` in the root directory:

Start the application:
### `npm start`

Localhost port is defaulted to 3000, but can be changed in package.json file by changing the start scripts.
### Example: "start": "PORT=3000 react-scripts start"

Application can be accessed via chrome browser:
http://localhost:3000

#### Feature changes
Pre-loader was imported from a third-party library. I would like to set it as the default for when the screen is loading and also center its position.
This same feature also has fetch capabilities already built in. I would love to add functionality that captures each users IP address, store it, then fetches that data to display on a map. This way users can see the locations where other viewers have contributed from!
